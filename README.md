Compiling

AutoPickup/McTyler uses Maven 3 to manage dependencies, packaging, and shading of necessary classes; Maven 3 is required to compile AutoPickup.

The typical command used to build AutoPickup is: mvn clean install (In the directory that contains the POM.xml)
You can get a copy of the latest Bukkit from your Spigot build Library. I use NetBeans IDE.
